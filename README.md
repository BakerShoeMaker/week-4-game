GAME NAME
Crystal Collector (GUMMY BEAR COLLECTOR)

OBJECT OF THE GAME:
The object of the game is to get the exact number in the number field. The user can click on each
image (Gummy Bear) to increase the value of their number. Each image has a different value.
If you guess maneuver to the correct number you win. If you go over the number you lose.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HTML, CSS, javascript, jquery, BootStrap 4, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome.

GENERAL COMMENTS:
Everytime the user wins or loses a sound plays to indicate winning or losing. In addition,
I used Font Awesome to display a thumbs-up or down for winning or losing. Sounds also
play when the user clicks the gummy bear image.

CHALLENGES:
The project was straight forward and I didn't experience any major issues with the base project. However, while adding
enhancements, mainly sprite sheet animations through CSS I found the following:
1) My CSS animations worked for some animations and for others, scrolled either up/down (like a slot machine graphic)
or right-to-left.
2) CSS sprite animations are not always straight forward.
3) The size and layout of the sprite sheet apparently makes a difference in how the animations 
will show.
4) I used Texture Packer to pack my animations but the coordinates on the CSS sometimes don't matter.
5) FYI, Texture Packer produces a png and a css file.
